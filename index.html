            Often site-specific, and occasionally occurring in public spaces, the boundaries of what constitutes installation art have been blurred since its very inception as an artistic genre. 
            Though installation art varies widely it can best be thought of as an umbrella term for three-dimensional works that aim to transform the audienceâ€™s perception of space. 
            Sometimes temporary, sometimes permanent, installation artworks have been constructed in spaces ranging from art galleries and museums to public squares and private homes and 
            will often envelop the viewer in an all-encompassing environment or within the space of the work itself. Installation art developed primarily in the second half of the 
            twentieth century (though there were clear precursors) as both minimalism and conceptual art evolved, culminating in installations in which the idea and experience was 
            more important than the finished work itself. See the artists below, all of whom have made a unique contribution to the dialogue about installation art and how it should be defined.
            The term "installation", which appeared in the 1970's, generally applies to works created for interior spaces (ie. gallery, museum); outdoor works are more often referred to as 
            public art, land art, or, to put it roughly, humans intervening on an environment and putting their "stamp" on it. That said, an outdoor piece can most certainly be considered 
            an "installation" of sorts, but, typically, installation art is most often found within an indoor space, as some artists would prefer to contain their creative statement 
            to the context of a room, which is simple enough for a viewer to comprehend.
