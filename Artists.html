            Installation artists are not always the most well-known artists many students of art history will come across when studying art, which is strange, 
            since installation art is some of the most groundbreaking and often hard-to-miss artistic statements that can be made. The list of popular and, in fact, 
            legendary installation artists is not a short one. As a student of art, and as someone obviously curious about the creative process, I hope you enjoy 
            this list of the most famous installation artists of all time that everyone should know about.

            Kurt Schwitters is best known for collages made out of paper scraps, wood, advertisements, and anything else he could get his hands on; 20th century Dada-artist Kurt Schwitters 
            (1887-1948) ultimately turned his own art studio into a collaged art installation. His studio-installation, entitled Merzbau, was borne out of an artistic 
            process which Schwitters explained as both a philosophy and a lifestyle branded “merz”. Merz was a nonsense word that the artist used to describe himself, 
            his life, and his work, meaning that his Merzbau was essentially his merz-building. Over the years his studio took on the form of a walk-in collage, 
            ever-shifting and ever-growing, composed of columns and stalagmites of found objects. Schwitters grew his Merzbau over time, eventually consuming eight rooms 
            in his home in Hannover from roughly 1923 until 1937, when he was forced to flee to Norway to escape Nazi Germany. By 1943, when he was still in exile, 
            the Merzbau was destroyed by an Allied bombing — effectively rendering Schwitters’ living site-specific artwork time-specific as well.

            Instantly recognisable and immensely iconic, Yayoi Kusama’s (1929-) series of Infinity Rooms has caught the imagination of her audience since 1965 with her 
            breakthrough Infinity Mirror Room – Phalli’s Field. By utilising mirrors as walls Kusama was able to translate the repetition of her earlier artworks into 
            an art installation, a seemingly endless room carpeted with polka-dotted fabric phallic structures. Since 1965 she has created over twenty more distinct 
            Infinity Mirror Rooms from peep-show-reminiscent boxes that audiences view from the outside-in, to larger multimedia installations full of internally-mirrored 
            inflated polka dots. Arguably a fan favorite with museum-going social media influencers are Kusama’s light-filled installations like Infinity Mirrored 
            Room—Aftermath of Obliteration of Eternity that features hundreds of hanging lanterns and paved with water. By tapping into the magic of mirrors, Kusama’s 
            work is able to trick the senses and create poetic art installations that speak to our most human responses, creating environments for existential contemplation.
